The license I decided to use for this project was Apache 2.0 since it is a business friendly license that encourages collaboration while still protecting both contributors and users. Apache 2.0 allows anyone to modify, use, and distribute the code-including for commercial purposes-as long as proper credit is given and the same license file is retained. It also includes explicit patent protection and a liability disclaimer, which is important for financial applications such as stock forecasting. It is also compatible with major machine learning libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn).
